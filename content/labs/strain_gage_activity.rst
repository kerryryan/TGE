Strain Gage Activity
====================

In this activity you will learn how to apply strain gages as a transducer to an
object of your choice. It could be a rock, a ceramic mug, or anything else you
think would have an interesting strain signal when squeezed, bent, or twisted
by hand. We will build on this activity for several classes when learning how
to condition, amplify, and record signals from transducers.

Materials
---------
* Item to instrument (rock, metal plate, etc.)
* Strain gages (4x)
* Small gage hookup wire
* Superglue
* Acetone and cloth
* Square
* Marker
* Soldering iron/solder
* Tweezers

Procedure
---------
#. Clean the surface you'll use with acetone. It the surface is very smooth,
   roughen it first with some emery cloth to help adhesion.
#. We will be creating a full bridge circuit using four gages. Layout a square
   pattern on your test object that lets you place a gage on each side of the
   square. Mark the center of each side as well. The needs to be really square
   and relatively accurately measured distances - use good technique!
#. Using the superglue and tweezers, place one gage centered on each side of
   the square you just laid out. Place a **small amount** of glue beneath each
   gage. Any glue that gets onto the contacts will make soldering much more
   difficult later!
#. After all of the glue has dried, hookup the strain gages in a full bridge
   configuration like that shown below.
#. Hookup your bridge to a power supply (a 9VDC battery works well) and to a DMM
   set to read DC Voltage. The output under no-strain should be near zero volts.
   When you squeeze or deform your test object, you should observe a change in the
   output voltage. Be sure you are using the lowest range on the meter as this
   signal will likely be a few millivolts. We need to amplify the signal, but that
   is a future activity.

Deliverables
------------
Show us your strain gaged object and the output voltage change when you stress
your object.
